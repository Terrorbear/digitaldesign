### Our Awesome Project Idea

Ethernet network repeater tool that allows the user to analyze, shape, and generate traffic.
We're targeting features to allow users to differentiate throughput according to the traffic type, diagnose connectivity issues, and monitor security risks.
Some of these features include logging traffic according to source and traffic category, analyzing bandwidth usage and latency, throttling or expediting specific streams, and testing experimental buffer drop policies.
Relevant information will be visualized to a user through a VGA source and they can select traffic shaping and analytic options with a keyboard.
Users will also be notified of alerts requiring immediate attention through audio output.
Our target audience ranges from internet providers and technical support teams to video gamers and other internet power users.
