### Our Awesome Project Idea

Ethernet network repeater tool that allows the user to analyze, shape, and generate traffic.
We're targeting features to allow users to differentiate throughput according to the traffic, diagnose connectivity issue, and monitor security risks.
Some of these features include logging traffic according to sources and traffic category, analyzing bandwidth usage and latecy, throttling or expediting specific streams, and testing experimental buffer drop policies.
Relevant information will be visualized to a user through a VGA source and they can select traffic shaping and analytic options with a keyboard and a mouse.
Users will also be notified of alerts requiring immediate attention through an audio output.
Our target audience ranges from internet providers and technical support teams to video gamers and other internet power users.
